# Training Data
* Task 1: Please sign the application [form](https://github.com/emerging-welfare/case-2021-shared-task/blob/main/CASE2021-Socio-political-and-Crisis-Events-Shared-Task-Individual-Application-Form.pdf) and send it to Ali Hürriyetoğlu (ahurriyetoglu@ku.edu.tr). The training data has been available since March 14, 2021.
* Task 2: For the training purposes one can use event-related textual data of any kind, where we recommend considering exploiting the short text snippets reporting events which are part of the large event dataset created by ACLED (https://acleddata.com/), and which can be obtained from ACLED using this web page: https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/ for academic purposes. Please send an e-mail to Nicolas Stefanovitch case2021.task.finegrained@gmail.com as soon as possible if you intend to work on this task.
* Task 3: There is not any training data for this task. The data utilized for tasks 2 and 3 or any additional data can be used to build systems/models that can determine Black Lives Matter (BLM) events in tweets and news articles.  The tweet collection that will be processed by the participants is collected using BLM specific hashtags.
